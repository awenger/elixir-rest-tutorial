Building a REST web service with Elixir

## Goal
The obvious goal of this tutorial is to create a basic REST web service in Elixir. The underlying motivation is to understand the concept of OTP and learn how to structure Elixir applications. This is the reason why this web service tutorial is solely based on plug and doesn't rely on a higher level framework like [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/). I hope you are already familiar with elixir, otherwise here is the [Introduction](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html).

My experience and knowledge about Elixir is very basic. So be prepared to find minor to outrages errors in this tutorial. I invite you to submit such errors as [Issues](https://github.com/awenger/elixir-rest-tutorial/issues) so that we can iterate and improve this REST web service and learn during this process.
